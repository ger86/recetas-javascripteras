# ✋🏼 Promise Methods ✋🏼

## 👨‍👩‍👧 Promise.all

It allows to know when all the Promises have been correctly resolved or when one of them is rejected.

```
const ENDPOINT_ONE = 'https://reqres.in/api/users/1';
const ENDPOINT_TWO = 'https://reqres.in/api/user/2';
const ENDPOINT_THREE = 'https://reqres.in/api/users/3';

const promises = [
  fetch(ENDPOINT_ONE),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_TWO),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_TWO)
];

try {
  const response = await Promise.all(promises);
  // response = [responseOne, responseTwo, responseThre]
} catch (reason) {
  // **first promise rejected**
}
```

## 🏃 Promise.race

It allows you to execute several promises at once and do something as soon as the first one is successfully resolved or rejected.

const ENDPOINT_NORMAL = 'https://reqres.in/api/users/1';
const ENDPOINT_QUICK = 'https://reqres.in/api/user/2';
const ENDPOINT_REJECTED = 'https://invalid.com';

```
const promises = [
  fetch(ENDPOINT_NORMAL),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_QUICK),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_REJECTED)
];
try {
  const response = await Promise.race(promises);
  // response = Response from ENPOINT_QUICK
} catch (reason) {
  //  If ENDPOINT_REJECTED is rejected before ENDPOINT_QUICK is resolver
}
```

## 🛬 Promise.allSettled

Returns a Promise that resolves once all Promises have been resolved or rejected and that contains an array that describes how each Promise ended.

```
const ENDPOINT_RESOLVED = 'https://reqres.in/api/user/2';
const ENDPOINT_REJECTED = 'https://invalid.com';

const promises = [
  fetch(ENDPOINT_RESOLVED),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_REJECTED)
];
Promise.allSettled(promises)
	.then(results => results.forEach(result => console.log(result)));
// ['fulfilled', 'rejected']
```


## ☝️ Promise.any

Returns a Promise as soon as it resolves but unlike Promise.race(), Promise.any() does not throw an exception if a Promise is rejected (for this to happen it is necessary that all have beenthey all need to have been).

```
const ENDPOINT_ONE = 'https://reqres.in/api/users/1';
const ENDPOINT_TWO = 'https://reqres.in/api/user/2';
const ENDPOINT_REJECTED = 'https://invalid.com';

const promises = [
  fetch(ENDPOINT_ONE),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_TWO),
  fetch(ENDPOINT_REJECTED)
];
try {
  const first = await Promise.any(promises);
  // Value of the first Promise that is resolved
  console.log(first);
} catch (error) {
  // All Promises were rejected
  console.log(error);
}
```
