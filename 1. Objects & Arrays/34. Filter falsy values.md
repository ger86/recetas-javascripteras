# Filter falsy values

🍕 This simple but very useful: use the `.filter()` method to remove falsy elements from an array. Instead, it returns a new array with the valid elements. Remember that the "falsy" values are the following:

- `false`
- `0`
- `""` (an empty text string)
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `NaN`


❗️Any other value not found in this list is considered truthy in JavaScript. These falsy values are important to be aware of when working with conditions and comparisons in JavaScript.

⭐️ This trick is particularly useful when working with lists of items where some of them may be optional or undefined. Instead of doing an extra check on each element, `.filter()` does the work for you.

```js
const meals = [
    '🍕',
    null,
    '🌮',
    undefined,
    '🍣',
    undefined,
]

const filteredMeals = meals.filter(Boolean)
filteredMeals // ["🍕", "🌮", "🍣"]
```
