# üï≥Ô∏è Void operator

The void operator evaluates the given expression and discards the result.

```js
function getName() {
  return '@latteandcode';
};

console.log(getName());
// @latteandcode

console.log(void getName());
// undefined
```

## Use cases

### Preventing navigation

You can use the void operator to prevent a page from navigating to a new URL when a user clicks on a link. This is useful when you want to perform some action on the current page without reloading it. For example, the following code would prevent the link from navigating to a new page and instead execute the JavaScript code in the onClick function:

```html
<a href="#" onClick="void(0); doSomething()">Click me</a>
```

### Creating a self-executing function
The void operator can also be used to create a self-executing function. This is a function that runs immediately without being called explicitly. To create a self-executing function, you can wrap your function code in parentheses and prefix it with the void operator. For example:

```js
void(function() {
  console.log('This function runs immediately!');
})();
```

### Preventing unintentional return values

In some cases, you may want to prevent a function from returning a value, even if it has one. For example, you may have a function that triggers some side effects but doesn't need to return anything. In this case, you can use the void operator to suppress the return value. For example:

```js
function doSomething() {
  // Some code that triggers side effects
  return 'This is the return value';
}
// Call the function and ignore the return value
void(doSomething());
```

Or:

```js

function getName() {
  return '@latteandcode';
}; 

button.addEventListener(
  'click',
  () => void getName()
);
```

### useImmer library

```js
function reducer(draft, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "reset":
      return initialState;
    case "increment":
      return void draft.count++;
    case "decrement":
      return void draft.count--;
  }
}
```
