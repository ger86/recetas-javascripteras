# Download file

This snippet of code is a JavaScript function called "downloadBlob", which is used to download a file generated from a Blob object. The function takes two arguments: "blob" (the Blob object) and "name" (the name of the file to be downloaded).

```js
export default function downloadBlob(blob: Blob, name: string): void {
  const a = document.createElement('a');
  a.href = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  a.download = name;
  a.target = '_blank';
  a.click();
}
```

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what the code does:

1. It creates an "a" element (a link) in the HTML document using `document.createElement('a')`.
2. It assigns the URL of the Blob object to the "href" attribute of the link using `URL.createObjectURL(blob)`. This generates a temporary URL representing the Blob object.
3. It sets the "download" attribute of the link to the value of "name", which is the name of the file to be downloaded.
4. It sets the "target" attribute of the link to "_blank" to ensure that if the browser cannot download the file directly, it will open in a new tab or window.
5. Finally, it simulates a click on the link using `a.click()`, which initiates the download of the file.
6. 
In summary, this function allows you to download a file generated from a Blob object with the specified name.
